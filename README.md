# Creating a GKE Cluster

This Terraform template creates a GKE cluster in Google Cloud Platform. The cluster name, node count, machine type, and subnetwork are specified in `variables.tf`. The `main.tf` file sets up the provider and calls the `gke_cluster` module, which is defined in the `modules/gke_cluster` directory.

The `gke_cluster` module uses the `terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google` module to create the GKE cluster. It also sets up the master authentication configuration and depends on a private VPC connection.

To create the GKE cluster, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the cluster is created, you can interact with it using the `gcloud` command-line tool. For example, to get the credentials for the cluster, run:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --region <region>
```

Example output:

```
Outputs:

cluster_ca_certificate = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIID..."
cluster_endpoint = "35.192.123.456"
```

# Creating a GKE Cluster

This Terraform configuration creates a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster in a specified region and subnetwork. The number of nodes, machine type, and zone can also be specified.

The `main.tf` file sets up the provider and calls the `gke_cluster` module, which is defined in `modules/gke_cluster/main.tf`. The `variables.tf` file defines the input variables for the configuration.

To create the GKE cluster, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the cluster is created, the endpoint and CA certificate can be retrieved using the output variables `cluster_endpoint` and `cluster_ca_certificate`.

Example output:

```
Outputs:

cluster_ca_certificate = -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

cluster_endpoint = https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```
